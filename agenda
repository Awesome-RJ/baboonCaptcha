Creating a Telegram Captcha bot:
- basic idea [x]
- demonstration [x]

Follow up:
- amend the callback data for buttons [x]
- if one fails to solve the captcha remove the buttons [x]
- give a time period for which one is allowed to solve the captcha [x]

ok now I believe all those concerns we had is addressed, now let me also address one more thing..
there is the difference of sky and ground in demonstrating an idea for you to pick up and a complete product
I am open to all kind of criticism and my main aim in doing these videos are to share the knowledge I have
gained, I am a self taught and my methods, my way of doing things might be a bit different to whats on text
book but listen guys, when I will to do something I bloody make sure that its done... and being the cool
guy of telegram doesnt really mean u pick point on everything, but yeah... you got to criticise however there
are ways of doing things and you should have learnt the difference in demos and complete... even the literal
word meaning... now that being said, SpechDi is an awesome developer I will leave a link to his git and
youtube channel as well.. give him some support, and also subscribe if you are not and show him some love
that being said thats all for this video... :-) have a nice day...
