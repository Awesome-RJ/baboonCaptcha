Creating a Telegram Captcha bot:
So I have lately been introduced to uCaptchaBot on telegram basically what it does is when a user joins a group
it asks the user to solve a captcha, well its pretty useful to avoid bots, spam and automated accounts, u know what I mean.
However I just couldnt sleep over it without doing something of my own, and here is how I created mine. we are going to
call it baboon... well lets talk less and jump into it eh?

Well that is pretty much it, now lets test before I explain breifly what I did,

oh that works like a charm...

now let me try breifly explain what it does...

so thats pretty much it, now the question is it complete.. nope it is not, you have to be creative, take this
as a foundation and put ur imagination to it, increase the number of buttons and the number of times a user
can try before he is completely banned and stuff. Is it unbreakable? most likely nope!! you need a pretty damn
good OCR to read those images programatically, but anyway u know what I mean... well thats all for todays video
have a nice day :-)
